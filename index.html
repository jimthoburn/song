The Gift by Angels and Airwaves

There’s the strangest excitement today,
if you’re awake then you’re welcome to hear.
I got a gift and it blew me away,
from the far eastern sea straight to here
Oh God I feel like I’m in for it now,
it’s like the rush has gone straight to my brain.
But my voice is as lonely as loud,
as I whisper the joy of this pain.

And suddenly, 
you’ve done it all. 
You’ve won me over, 
in no time at all.

And now I’ll stop the storm if it rains
I’ll light a path far from here
I’ll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear.

If you ask I will do what you say
All we have is this night to get through
With a twist of your smile your own way
you left me all up in arms and confused
Oh God I feel like I’m in for it now
And how this kiss will be wonderfully vain
I swear I’ll melt if you touch me at all,
but then I’ll ask you to do it again and again

And suddenly, 
you’ve done it all. 
You’ve won me over, 
in no time at all.

And now I’ll stop the storm if it rains
I’ll light a path far from here
I’ll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear.

I’ll stop the storm if it rains
I’ll light a path far from here
I’ll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear.

And now I’ll stop the storm if it rains
I’ll light a path far from here
I’ll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear.

I’ll stop the storm if it rains
I’ll light a path far from here
I’ll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear.

Make the world we know disappear.
